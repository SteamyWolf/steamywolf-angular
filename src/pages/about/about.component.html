        <p class="about-container__paragraph">
            After looking around at the current state of furry sites, I noticed that none of them focused on simplicity and artwork. 
            It seems they drift to including as much content as possible. While this isn't inherently wrong, I became frustrated just trying to find
            what I love most; some nice furry art.

            While this site does allow NSFW content, I will not tolerate explicite material that breaks the
            <a>Terms of Service</a> agreement. You can read that to get a better idea of what is not allowed.
            You can use the report button in a post which will send me an email of the issue and I will address it.
